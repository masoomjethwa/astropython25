# 🌟 VASCSC ASTROpython – Space & Python Fun! (2025)

Welcome to the VASCSC Space Camp! 🎉  
In this fun 5-day class, we’ll learn how to **code in Python** and use it to explore the **amazing universe**—with real space data from NASA! 🚀

---

## 🚀 What Will We Do?

In this course, you’ll:

- Learn the basics of Python, a powerful programming language
- Use real tools that scientists use (like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Astropy)
- Explore **asteroids**, **stars**, and **space pictures**
- Learn how scientists study space and use data from real space telescopes
- Try fun activities like calculating rocket speed and finding cool things in space
